Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Overview
--------

This course consists of readings in the history of the form of the detective story, from the 19th-century to the present. It involves studies in questions of knowing, from materialist puzzles through metaphysical meditations to elegant whimsy, from murder in an English country village to crowned jewels buried in a footnote.

Attendance
----------

Because we'll do much of the work of this subject through discussions, naturally I'll expect you to be actively here during class and to practice the skills of a good participant: informed attention, preparation, helpful contribution, talking, assimilation, generous and intelligent listening, and mutual respect.

Readings
--------

Do all the readings. We'll have quizzes every week or so. Results of those quizzes account for ca. 25% of the final grade.

Quizzes and Exam
----------------

Frequent quizzes; short final exercise.
